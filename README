This is a project for scraping cars and car prices from a website in Kenya and finding out the factors that influence the prices of cars. I scraped the data from used cars Kenya and used Python and Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis.
The analysis is not complete in this note notebook because the correlation matrix shows very little correlation and the features i extracted from scikit-learn require that i re-look into the data.
So i decided to look into the data again!
But the notebook still shows my progress so i decided to include it
